0,"This dataset contains cortical regions only, permitting benchmarking against available published datasets. The samples where chipped specifically from the cortex (all cortical layers) with leptomeninges left intact. The latter was primarily to avoid inconsistency across the samples in terms of the amount of glial cell population included had the white matter been also included.Cortical regions (anterior cingulate cortex, cortex of middle frontal gyrus, cortex of middle temporal gyrus, cortex of inferior parietal lobule) were selected to reflect known Lewy pathology progression across the cortical regions (cingulate first affected; parietal last affected). We decided to leave leptomeninges intact on the cortex, because technically it is difficult to strip them off prior detrimental thawing of the tissue. Samples (stored at -80 prior chipping) where chipped on dry ice (200mg for snRNA).","From protocols.io: This protocol is used to isolate nuclei from frozen brain tissue for single nuclear RNA sequencing using 10x Genomics GEM isolation using the Chromium accessory and Single Cell 3สน Reagent Kits. It is adapted from a protocol designed by Carlo Sala Frigerio. The nuclei are homogenised by hand, run through a density gradient, resuspended, counted and diluted to an appropriate concentration to run in the Chromium. This protocol is designed to be continued with the Chromium Single Cell 3' Reagent Kits User Guide (v3.1 Chemistry Dual Index) to isolate nuclei in GEMs.","'Nuclei were extracted from homogenised post-mortem tissue, isolated with a concentration gradient and loaded onto a 10x Chromium using Single Cell 3สน Reagent Kits (v3.1 Chemistry Dual Index) and accessories. cDNA Libraries were made as per 10X instructions (User Guide: Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3สน Reagent Kits v3.1 (Dual Index).
