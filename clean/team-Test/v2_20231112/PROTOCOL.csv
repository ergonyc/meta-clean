0,The samples were collected by the Banner Sun Health brain bank and were flash frozen.,See protocol.,Library preps were generated via the 5' 10x Genomics Chromium Next GEM Single Cell V(D)J Reagent Kit v1.1 protocol.,"We use cellranger count (6.0.1) to align and generate counts. Data is loaded into R using Seurat, where QC & filtering are performed, followed by batch correction for normalization between samples, clustering to identify transcriptionally similar cells, and annotation of these clusters using canonical cell-type specific marker genes. For analysis, we compare cell type proportions, evalute differentially expressed genes, and look at upregulated and downregulated pathways between the PD samples and controls.",private repo at https://github.com/TheGBLab/ASAP,https://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.bzmgp43w,
