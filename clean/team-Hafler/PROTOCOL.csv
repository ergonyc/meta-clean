0,"Prefrontal cortex (Brodmann area 9, Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) obtained from postmortem PD and non-diseased age- and sex-matched control individuals was provided by brain tissue biorepository at Nathan Kline Institute and New York University (NKI/NYUGSOM).","Nuclei were isolated from post-mortem fresh frozen human brain tissue. Frozen tissue (50 to 100 mg) was homogenized in 15 ml of ice-cold nuclei homogenization buffer [2 M sucrose, 10 mM Hepes (pH 7.9), 25 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA (pH 8.0), 10% glycerol, and ribonuclease (RNase) inhibitors freshly added (80 U/ml)] with Dounce tissue grinder (10 strokes with loose pestle and 10 strokes with tight pestle). The homogenate was transferred into an ultracentrifuge tube on top of 10 ml of fresh nuclei homogenization buffer and centrifuged at 25,000 rpm for 60 min at 4°C on a ultracentrifuge. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of nuclei resuspension buffer [15 mM Hepes (pH 7.4), 15 mM NaCl, 60 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 3 mM CaCl2, and RNase inhibitors freshly added (80 U/ml)] and counted on a hemocytometer for 10x loading. ",The snRNA-seq libraries were prepared by the 10x Genomics Chromium Single Cell 3′ Reagent Kit v3 chemistry according to the manufacturer’s instructions and sequenced using Illumina NovaSeq6000 S4.,A custom pre-mRNA human genome reference was generated with GRCh38 (Ensembl 93) that included pre-mRNA sequences by 10x Cell Ranger. snRNA-seq data were aligned to this GRCh38–premRNA human genome reference (Ensembl 93) to map both unspliced pre-mRNA and mature mRNA using 10x CellRanger version 3.1.0.,,,
