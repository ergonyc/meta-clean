0,Single-cell transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of Parkinson’s disease brains,Single nucleus RNA sequencing dataset of PD brain prefrotal cortex,"We provide an extensive single cell analysis profiling nearly 80,000 brain nuclei from prefrontal cortex of late-stage Parkinson’s disease brains, demonstrate that α-synuclein pathology is inversely correlated with chaperone expression in excitatory neurons, found a selective abatement of neuron-astrocyte interactions with enhanced neuroinflammation, and augmented the study with proteomic analysis and cross-comparisons with Alzheimer’s disease datasets, providing valuable insights into the pathways of neurodegeneration and a deep definition of the underlying molecular pathology for Parkinson’s disease.",TEAM-HAFLER,Le Zhang Lab,Le Zhang,Le.zhang@yale.edu,Le Zhang,Le Zhang,Le.zhang@yale.edu,ASAP-000529,Nan,Doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.02.14.480397,Nan,12,Prefrontal cortex,Late-stage PD and control postmortem brains,0000-0002-4860-831X,Nan,Nan,V1_08/27/2023
